Automated analysis of Arabic data sets including texts, publications, records, and digital media
became essential with the huge digital Arabic content available nowadays. The current
solutions adopt data and text mining techniques that are suitable for Latin languages. The
Arabic language has unique features that differentiate it from other languages and that can
help text mining and information retrieval techniques. In this project we aim at developing
Arabic text mining tools and techniques to handle complex queries on separate but related
Arabic documents. Given a set of documents and a relation expressed in a query form, we will
use structural analysis techniques to extract graphs representing the relation and the different
entities involved in the given documents.
